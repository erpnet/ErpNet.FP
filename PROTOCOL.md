# Concepts

## Printer Id

Each printer is identified by its printerId. Although the library consumer does not need to know the exact specifics of the algorithm for generating the printerId, they are provided here for completeness:

1. For locally connected printers, the printerId is the printer serial number.
For example: "dy448967"

2. If a local printer is connected through multiple transports (for example: both COM and BT), the id for each next transport connection is assigned a consecutive number.
For example: "dy448967_1"
Note: The algorithm runs always in the same order. Unless transports are changed, the id would remain constant. However, it is advised to always use the default, non-numeric id.

3. For network printers, the printerId is provided in the configuration file.
For example: "FP_Room1"

## Printer Uri

When a printer is detected, the http server saves something, called printer Uri. The Uri contains the connection information to connect to the printer. It contains details about printer driver, transport and path to the printer. It is similar to the connection string pattern. Example Uris:
- bg.dy.isl.com://COM5
- bg.dy.isl.com://COM3
- bg.dt.x.isl.com://COM21
- bg.zk.zfp.http://fp5.mycompany.com
- bg.dt.p.isl.tcp://192.168.1.77:9100
- etc.

The printer Uri is currently used only internally in the http server. Still, it is exposed as part of the device info. In the future, there might be methods to use the printers through their Uri.

# Available requests

*Remark:* For all requests from now on, we will assume that, we are doing them on the local computer at: **http://localhost:8001**

Of course, this is not a must, and you can substitute the address and port, with yours, as well as the protocol, it can be both http and https.

## `GET` Get The List Of Printers
This request gets the list of available printers. The available printers are either auto-detected, or created by a config file.

Prints a fiscal receipt to the specific printer with operator credentials. The syntax is the same, but two additional fields are presented, **"operator"**, and **"operatorPassword"**.

### Example request uri:
```
http://localhost:8001/printers/dt279013/receipt
```

### Example request body:
```json
{
  "uniqueSaleNumber": "DT279013-0001-0000001",
  "operator": "1",
  "operatorPassword": "1",
  "items": [
    {
      "text": "Cheese",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": 12,
      "taxGroup": 2
    },
    {
      "text": "Additional comment to the cheese...",
      "type": "comment"
    },
    {
      "text": "Milk",
      "quantity": 2,
      "unitPrice": 10,
      "taxGroup": 2,
      "priceModifierValue": 10,
      "priceModifierType": "discount-percent"
    }
  ],
  "payments": [
    {
      "amount": 30,
      "paymentType": "cash"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example response:  
It will be the same, as when we call Print Receipt without operator credentials.

## `POST` Print Fiscal Receipt (Async)
Asynchronously prints a fiscal receipt to the printer. The receipt is printed as a whole transaction. If there is any error while printing, the printing is aborted and the receipt is voided.

### Example request uri:
```
http://localhost:8001/printers/dt525860/receipt?asyncTimeout=0
```

### Async Execution
Asynchronous execution of print tasks allows the server to continue processing a print task after it has returned result to the caller. 
When a print task is executed asynchronously, the task is placed in a queue and the server only returns **"taskId"** to the caller.

To activate asynchronous execution, the caller should specify **"asyncTimeout"** parameter.

The **"asyncTimeout"** parameter specifies the timeout, after which the task is converted to asynchronous. Possible values are:
* **not specified** - when the parameter is not specified, the task is executed synchronously. The server waits for a printing to complete and only then returns result.
* **asyncTimeout=xxx** - the task is executed synchronously. If the task finishes before the specified timeout (xxx is number of milliseconds), task result is returned to the caller. If the task takes longer to execute, the server returns **"taskId"** result.
* **asyncTimeout=0** - the task is scheduled for execution and the server immediately returns **"taskId"** result.
NOTE: Asynchrounous execution (through the asyncTimeout parameter) is available for all print requests.

### Example request body
Тhe same as when calling Print Receipt.

### Example response 
```json
{
  "taskId": "QHC_H_7u8EaAjTB7WPEP3g"
}
```
**"taskId"** result
The **"taskId"** result is demonstated in the example return value. It contains a single **taskId** token, which can be used to later make **"taskinfo"** requests to check its status. Bellow you will see how we will use the returned **taskId** identifier **QHC_H_7u8EaAjTB7WPEP3g** to get the status of, or result information of the printed receipt.

## `POST` Print Fiscal Receipt (Idempotent)
Prints a fiscal receipt to the printer and guarantees idempotency.
Idempotency, if properly implemented, guarantees that the caller will have total guarantee whether the document was printed or not, even in the case of (temporary) network problems.

### Idempotency
In order to achieve idempotency, the caller should create (and provide it as а paramater) a unique taskId for each print task. 
This would allow the caller to properly check the task status, even in the case when the inital call has not returned response properly (due to network issues, for example).

It is suggested, that the taskId is a short, but unique string, serialized as base64 string.

### Example request uri:
```
http://localhost:8001/printers/dt525860/receipt?asyncTimeout=0&taskId=QHC_H_7u8EaAjTB7WPEP3g
```

### Example request body
Тhe same as when calling Print Receipt.

### Example response 
```json
{
  "taskId": "QHC_H_7u8EaAjTB7WPEP3g"
}
```

## `GET` Get Async Task Information
Returns information about an async printing task. Async printing tasks are created, when **"asyncTimeout"** parameter is used on any printing task. For more information about creating async printing tasks, see the documentation of "Print Fiscal Receipt (Async)".

### Example request uri:
```
http://localhost:8001/printers/taskinfo?id=QHC_H_7u8EaAjTB7WPEP3g
```

### The response:
The **"taskinfo"** action will return information about a task. The information includes:

**taskStatus** - This is one of: 
* **"unknown"** - there is no information about the task (see below),  
* **"enqueued"** - the task is waiting in the queue, 
* **"running"** - the task is being currently executed, 
* **"finished"** - the task has finished, 
* **"result"** - only returned for "finished" tasks. Contains the data, returned by the task.
When a print task is created, it is put in a FIFO print queue. If the user requests a synchronous print method, the method returns result only after all previously enqueued tasks and the current task have finished.

Therefore, it is always recommended to use async requests.

Upon finishing a print task, the server moves it to a "completed" list of print tasks. The information about the completed task sits in the "completed" list up to the restart of the service. After this, the information about the print task is not available and further requests for information about this task will return unknown status.

When the caller requests info about a task and the returned status is finished, the server also deletes the information about the task (and further inquiries about this task status will return unknown).

## `POST` Print Reversal Receipt
Prints a receipt, which reverses another (normal) receipt.

NOTE: The quantities and amounts in the reversal receipt are again POSITIVE values. You do not have to specify minus values.

### Example request uri:
```
http://localhost:8001/printers/dt525860/reversalreceipt
```

The reversal receipt JSON input format is mostly the same as PrintReceipt. The call also requires some additional values, which were obtained as result information from the PrintReceipt call. The fields in addition/changed, compared to PrintReceipt are:

* **"uniqueSaleNumber"** - should contain the same number, which was on the original receipt. You MUST NOT create new unique number for the reversal.
* **"receiptNumber"** (obtained from the original receipt return info)
* **"receiptDateTime"** (obtained from the original receipt return info)
* **"fiscalMemorySerialNumber"** (obtained from the original receipt return info)
* **"reason"** - the reason for the reversal. One of: 
* * **"operator-error"**
* * **"refund"**
* * **"taxbase-reduction"**. (it should be "tax-base-reduction", but because of the backward compatibility issues, we will stick with "taxbase-reduction").

### Response
The same as PrintReceipt, except for the "info" section, which is not provided (not needed).
